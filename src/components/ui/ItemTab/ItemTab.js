          It doesnâ€™t contain as much as coffee, but enough to produce a response
          without causing the jittery effects associated with taking in too much
          caffeine. Caffeine affects the brain by blocking an inhibitory
          neurotransmitter called adenosine. This way, it increases the firing
          of neurons and the concentration of neurotransmitters like dopamine
          and norepinephrine (4Trusted Source, 5). Research has consistently
          shown that caffeine can improve various aspects of brain function,
          including mood, vigilance, reaction time, and memory (6).
